# retailStore

Time Read me was created: 6:33pm

Requirements:
- Implement a web page based on the design prototype, you do NOT have to be “pixel perfect”. But we would recommend trying to meet 90% of the design at the same same screen size.
- Responsive web design. The site needs to fit to the different size of the user’s screen. Only large desktop and mobile design are provided. You need to fill in the blank on what the page looks like in between.
- Add to cart section (main body of the page)
- mini cart section (top right)
- Add to cart functionality

Tried implementing the javascript functionalities but ran out of time in my end. 

Time finished: 9:18pm
